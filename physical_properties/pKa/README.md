# SAMPL6 pKa Prediction Challenge

This challenge consists of predicting microscopic and macroscopic pKas of 24 small organic molecules. These fragment-like small molecules are selected for their similarity to kinase inhibitors and for experimental tractability. Our aim is to evaluate how well current pKa prediction methods perform with drug fragment-like molecules through blind predictions.

## Manifest

- `/molecule_ID_and_SMILES.csv` - CSV file that indicates SAMPL6 pKa challenge molecule IDs and canonical isomeric SMILES.
- `/microstates/` - This directory contains files that list of microstate IDs and canonical isomeric SMILES of microstates. Files are separated by molecule ID.
- `/submission_templates/` - Empty prediction submission template files are located here.
- `/example_submission_files/` - Soon this directory will contain example submission files filled with random values to illustrate expected format.
