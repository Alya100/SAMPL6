Notes

- Mean and 95\% confidence intervals of statistic values were calculated by bootstrapping.

- Submissions with submission IDs nb001, nb002, nb003, nb004, nb005 and nb005 include non-blind corrections to pKa predictions of only SM22 molecule. 

pKas of the rest of the molecules in these submissions were blindly predicted before experimental data was released.

- pKa predictions of Epik-sequencial method (submission ID: nb007) were not blind. They were submitted after the submission deadline to be used as a reference method.
