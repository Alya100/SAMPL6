# Submission Type I
#
# PREDICTION SECTION
#
# Fill one typeI_microscopic_pKas_and_microstates.csv template for all molecules predicted with the same method.
# For each molecule, report as many microscopic pKas as your method predicts.
# Add new lines for each microstate pair.
# Report microscopic pKa values to two decimal places (e.g. 10.71).
# Reporting the standard error of the mean (SEM) is optional, but if reported, two decimal places should be provided (e.g. 1.02).
# For values which you don't have an estimate, leave that cell of the csv table empty.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be structured as follows:
# microstate ID of protonated state(HA), microstate ID of deprotonated state(A), microscopic pKa, microscopic pKa SEM
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Prediction:" keyword, as illustrated here.
Predictions:



# NAME SECTION
#
# Please provide an informal yet informative name of the method used.
# The "Name:" keyword is required, as shown here.
Name:



# SOFTWARE SECTION
#
# All major software packages used and their versions.
# Create a new line for each software.
# The "Software:" keyword is required.
Software: 



# METHOD SECTION
#
# Methodology and computational details. 
# Level of detail should be at least that used in a publication.  
# Please include the values of key parameters, with units, and explain how any statistical uncertainties were estimated.
# Use as many lines of text as you need. 
# All text following the "Method:" keyword will be regarded as part of your free text methods description.
