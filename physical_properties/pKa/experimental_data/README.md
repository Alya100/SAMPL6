## Experimental pKa values of SAMPL6 pKa challenge molecules
This directory contains results of the pKa measurements performed with Sirius T3 instruments for 24 small molecules. 
3 independent replicate pKa measurements were done for each molecule, starting from the same DMSO stock solution.
Please see [SAMPL6/pKa Challenge Instructions/Experimental Details](https://github.com/MobleyLab/SAMPL6/blob/master/pKa_challenge_instructions.md#experimental-details) for more details about the experiment.

`pKa_experimental_values.csv` file contains mean and standard error of the mean(SEM) of experimental macroscopic pKa values, calculated using `calc_pKa_value_statistics.py` script.
Since pKa values measured by Sirius T3 were reported with 2 decimal places, we have reported SEM as 0.01 in cases where SEM values calculated from 3 replicates were lower than 0.01.  

## Manifest
- `pKa_experimental_values.csv` - Mean and SEM of pKa values organized in tabular format. Upto three pKa values are reported based on how many were measured in the experimental interval of 2-12.
- `calc_pKa_value_statistics.py` - Python script used to calculate mean and SEM of pKa values.
- `pKa_replicate_experimental_results.csv` - Experimental results that contain pKa values measured in independent replicates and name of experimental report(PDF file).
- `experiment_reports\` - This directory contains reports generated by Sirius T3 software for the results of pKa measurements. Refer to `pKa_replicate_experimental_results.csv` for matching SAMPL6 molecule IDs to report file names.
- `experimental_ID_and_SAMPL6_molecule_ID_table.csv` - Table that matches experimental molecule IDs to SAMPL6 molecule IDs.
