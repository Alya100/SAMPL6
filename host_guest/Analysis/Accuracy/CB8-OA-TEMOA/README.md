# Analysis of CB8, OA, and TEMOA predictions

Statistics and correlation plots for methods that were used to predict CB8, OA, and TEMOA binding free energies.

## Manifest

- `FreeEnergyCorrelationPlots/`: Correlation plots showing experimental against predicted free energies for all submissions.
- `EnthalpiesCorrelationPlots/`: Correlation plots experimental against predicted enthalpy (only submissions reporting enthalpies).
- `StatisticsTables/`: Tables reporting RMSE, mean absolute error, mean error, Pearson coefficient of determination,
linear regression slope, and Kendall's tau coefficient for all submissions with 95%-percentile bootstrap confidence
interval in CSV, JSON and PDF format.
