# SAMPLing challenge results for absolute free energy calculations
#
# This file will be automatically parsed. It must contain the following five sections: predictions, computational cost,
# software listing, technical details, and method description. These elements must be provided in the order shown.
#
# The data in each prediction line should be a comma-separated list of exactly 201 fields, 100 of which are optional.
# Each line must be structured as follows: system ID, F(1%), dF(1%), F(2%), dF(2%), ..., F(100%), dF(100%), where
# F(X%) and dF(X%) are respectively the free energy estimate and free energy uncertainty, both in kcal/mol, after X% of
# the calculation. The free energy uncertainties are optional (see example below).
#
# The "Prediction" section should have at least 15 lines: 5 replicates starting from the provided initial configurations
# for each of the 3 host-guest systems in the challenge (i.e., CB8-G3, OA-G3, and OA-G6). Data submission for further replicates
# or different systems is welcomed, although not required.
#
# The list of predictions must begin with the "Prediction:" keyword, as illustrated here.

TechnicalDetails:
All the simulations were performed on 16 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 Ti on a cluster hosting 32 x Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2640 v3 @ 2.60GHz. Every lambda window of our simulations was run in one GPU, thus 16 lambda windows were run in parallel.
For each molecule, the total wall-clock time was estimated by summing up all the recorded times for each lambda window for each 
phase and process simulated.

Method:
The estimation of binding free energy of a molecule from Molecular Dynamics simulations is performed through the double annihilation approach by using the thermodynamic cycle. In the first step, called discharging step, the charges of the guest are turned off both in free phase (only the ligand) and in bound phase (ligand and receptor together), providing the discharging free energy changes. In the second step, called vanishing step, the guest becomes <<non-interacting>>, as the van der Waals terms are also switched off both in solvent and complex phase, giving the vanishing free energy changes in both phases.These steps are performed with a series of alchemical intermediate states based on a coupling parameter 0 < λ < 1. So we compute the binding free energy by subtracting the sum of the free energy changes in the bound phase from the sum of the free energy changes in the free phase. The above calculations will be referred to as Model A. In the final step, the ligand becomes <<non-interacting>> so a restraint is needed so that the guest does not drift out from the host’s binding site. For this reason, a flat-bottom restraining potential is used between one atom of the ligand that is the closest to the center of mass and four equivalent atoms of the host and it is added to the potential energy function of the system.

In the CB8 systems concerning the discharging step, 9 equidistant λ windows were used for the bound and the free phase. For the vanishing step in the free phase 11 equidistant lambda windows were used and an additional window was added at 0.950, to capture large fluctuations  in the free energy changes towards the end of the decoupling process. For the bound vanishing step these lambda windows were employed: 0.000, 0.050, 0.100, 0.150, 0.200, 0.250, 0.300, 0.350, 0.400, 0.450, 0.500, 0.550, 0.600, 0.700, 0.850, 1.000, in order to capture large fluctuations  in the free energy changes towards the beginning of the decoupling process. 
All simulations were run for 20 ns with Sire/OpenMM6.3 (SOMD) software (revision 2017.1.0), in an NPT ensemble and temperature control was achieved with an Andersen Thermostat with a coupling constant of 10 ps-1. Pressure was maintained by a Monte Carlo barostat that attempted isotropic box edge scaling every 100 fs. Periodic boundary conditions were imposed with a 12 Å atom-based cutoff distance for the non-bonded interactions, using a Barker Watts reaction field with dielectric constant of 78.3.

For the OA systems the discharging step used 9 equidistant λ windows the bound and the free phase. For the vanishing step, both in free and bound phase, 11 equidistant lambda windows were employed and an additional window was added at 0.950, to capture large fluctuations in the free energy changes towards the end of the decoupling process. All simulations were run for 20 ns with Sire/OpenMM6.3 (SOMD) software (revision 2017.1.0), in an NPT ensemble and temperature control was achieved with an Andersen Thermostat with a coupling constant of 10 ps-1.

Periodic boundary conditions were imposed with a 12 Å atom-based cutoff distance for the non-bonded interactions, using a Barker Watts reaction field with dielectric constant of 78.3.

Analysis was carried out using the multistat Bennet acceptance ratio (MBAR). For the better estimation of the computed binding free energy in terms of convergence of the results, we computed the binding free energy for every percent of the simulation, ie 1%,2%,...,100%. For each percentage, pymbar gives an error estimation as output. This error was propagated through all the phases, to retrieve the final standard error estimation.

The final binding free energy estimation does not have a well-defined reference state. That is why we need a standard state correction, that is going to be substracted from the obtained free energy of binding. The above corrections to the binding free energy can be referred to as Model C.

The absolute free energies of binding obtained by use of the above protocol were corrected to account for specific errors:

Model C) A correction term for the use of the flat-bottom distance restraints was also applied to bring the decoupled guest to a standard concentration. This term was evaluated by numerical integration of the configuration integral of a potential energy function that solely contains contributions from the flat-bottom distance restraints.
